Vocalize: Effortless Expense Tracking with AI
🚀 About Vocalize
Vocalize is a revolutionary expense tracking application designed to simplify your financial life. Forget tedious manual data entry – with Vocalize, you can simply speak your transactions, and our intelligent AI agent will handle the rest! Whether you're tracking daily coffees, groceries, or major bills, Vocalize makes managing your money as intuitive as a conversation.
